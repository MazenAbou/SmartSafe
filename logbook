Log Entries
Week 1: Ideation & Planning
Date: 02/11/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Chosen Idea: Smart door lock.
Brainstormed features and functionalities.
Assigned roles to each team member.
Created a rough design sketch.

Week 2: Component Acquisition & Initial Prototyping
Date: 02/18/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Chosen a different idea (Smart Safe) due to some difficulties on the hardware side, like the doorknob mechanism.
Researched necessary components.
Purchased electronic components.
Assembled the Arduino and tested basic input/output functionality.
Started wiring and programming the keypad

Week 3: Hardware & Software Integration
Date: 02/25/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Integrated LCD display, LEDs, a Buzzer, and a servomotor for the locking mechanism.
Developed initial code.
Created an enclosure prototype using Inkscape and a laser-cut machine.
 Challenges & Solutions:
No enough pins in Arduino Uno for LCD display and 4x4 keypad → used Shift Register (SN74HC595) which reduced the number of pins used by the LCD display from 6 pins to 3 pins.
 Next Steps: Use the I2C adapter (PCF8574) for the final project.

Week 4: Testing & Debugging
Date: 03/04/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Conducted unit tests on entering the code using the keypad.
Debugged issues related to LCD display after using the shift register.
Improved the LCD display to turn the backlight off after 5 seconds if it is not in use.
Improved security features (allowing the user to change the passcode).
 Challenges & Solutions:
Coding the LCD display → Downloaded and used library (LiquidCrystal_74HC595.h).
 Next Steps: Adding RFID for the final project.

Week 5: Presentation Preparation
Date: 03/11/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Conducted final functional tests.
Created presentation slides and report.

Week 6: 
Date: 03/25/2025
Replacing the Shift Register with I2C. Testing the LCD with I2C, it works well after adjusting the potentiometer on the I2C.
Testing the RFID and the distance, it can read the card from around ¾ inch without a barrier. Same distance with 3mm inch wood.
Created a 3D model for the final look of the project.
Tried different codes.
 
Week 7:
Date: 04/01/2025
Tested and fixed the keypad. The keypad we ordered has arrived defective; some of the keys are not functioning. Mazen opened the keypad cover and fixed it by wiring it externally.
Coding RFID, making sure it works with the keypad. At first, there was conflict between them; when the keypad works, the RFID doesn’t, and vice versa. 
Then we were able to fix the code so both can work at the same time.
 
Week 8:
Date: 04/15/2025
Started preparing the design for laser cutting using Inkscape software. We decided to make the safe at a larger size so it can be versatile and not only for small objects.
 
Week 9:
Date: 04/22/2025
Tested battery charger module (LiPo Rider Plus). Used a 3.7V Battery, the module boost it to 5V.
Recharge it via USB-C. Tried to connect to the Arduino Uno, using USB-A, and it worked well. However, connecting it by barrel jack, it did not work. “Arduino Barrel Jack requires at least 7V to power it up.”

Week 10:
Date: 04/29/2025
Final tests and code adjustments.
