Log Entries
Week 1: Ideation & Planning
Date: 02/11/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Chosen Idea: Smart door lock.
Brainstormed features and functionalities.
Assigned roles to each team member.
Created a rough design sketch.



Week 2: Component Acquisition & Initial Prototyping
Date: 02/18/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Chosen a different idea (Smart Safe) due to some difficulties on the hardware side, like the doorknob mechanism.
Researched necessary components.
Purchased electronic components.
Assembled the Arduino and tested basic input/output functionality.
Started wiring and programming the keypad



Week 3: Hardware & Software Integration
Date: 02/25/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Integrated LCD display, LEDs, Buzzer, and a servomotor for locking mechanism.
Developed initial code.
Created an enclosure prototype using Inkscape and laser cut machine.
 Challenges & Solutions:
No enough pins in Arduino Uno for LCD display and 4x4 keypad → used Shift Register (SN74HC595) which reduced the number of pins used by the LCD display from 6 pins to 3 pins.
 Next Steps: Use I2C adapter (PCF8574) for the final project.

Week 4: Testing & Debugging
Date: 03/04/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Conducted unit tests on entering the code using the keypad.
Debugged issues related to LCD display after using the shift register.
Improved the LCD display to turn the backlight off after 5 seconds if it is not in use.
Improved security features (allowing the user to change the passcode).
 Challenges & Solutions:
Coding the LCD display → Downloaded and used library (LiquidCrystal_74HC595.h).
 Next Steps: Adding RFID for the final project.

Week 5: Presentation Preparation
Date: 03/11/2025
 Tasks Completed:
Conducted final functional tests.
Created presentation slides and report.
